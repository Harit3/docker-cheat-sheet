## What is Docker

"Docker is a tool which helps developers build and ship high quality applications, faster."

## Why Docker

With Docker, developers can build any app in any language using any toolchain. Dockerized apps are completely portable and can run anywhere.

Developers can get going by just spinning any container out of list on Docker Hub. Docker manages and tracks changes and dependencies, making it easier for sysadmins to understand how the apps that developers build work. And with Docker Hub, developers can automate their build pipeline and share artifacts with collaborators through public or private repositories.
